STEPS:
1. Traverse through the array and for each element, find it's quotient when divided by 'k' and add it to the count.
2. Find it's reminder when divided by 'k' and if it is:
    - > 0, then add 1 to the count
    - = 0, then continue
3. Remember the edge case where an element in the array is equal to zero. Increment the count by 1 in this case as well.
4. Return the count.
