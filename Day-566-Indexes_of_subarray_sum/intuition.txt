INTUITION:
1. As we only have non-negative numbers in the array, we can use the two pointer approach to solve this problem.
2. We apply the typical two pointer approach, but make sure to take care of the edge case; when you reach the end of the array, we may have to remove some elements from the front to achieve the answer. Run a while loop for this.
