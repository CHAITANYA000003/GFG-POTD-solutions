The idea in this is to store the product of all the elements is a variable and then iterate the array and replace ith element of the array with product/current_index_value in a array. and then return this array.

EDGE CASES:
1. When you have only 1 zero in the array: Calculate the product without including this zero. The index of this zero in the answer array will have this product whereas all the remaining elements will be zero.
2. When you have more than 1 zero: All the elements in the ans array will be zero.
