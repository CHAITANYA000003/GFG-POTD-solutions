We need to return the number of vertical lines on the binary tree. Consider the X-Axis with the root on x = 0.
The idea then is to use a traversal technique where we increment the value of 'x' everytime we move right and decrement it when we move left.
We store the minimum possible value in the 'left' variable, and the maximum value in the 'right' variable.
We finally return `right - left + 1`. The '1' is to compensate for the line on the 0-index(root node).
