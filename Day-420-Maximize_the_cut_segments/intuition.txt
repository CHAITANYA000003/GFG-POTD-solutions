BRUTE FORCE APPROACH:
In the recursive approach, we'll try all possible cut lengths (x, y, and z) for the current line segment and recursively find the maximum number of cut segments for the remaining segment after making each cut. We'll choose the maximum among the three possibilities.

BRUTE FORCE OPTIMIZED (MEMOIZATION):
Memoization is used to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations. We'll create a memoization table to keep track of the maximum number of cuts for line segments of different lengths, starting from 0 to n.

OPTIMIZED APPROACH (TABULATION):
As the solution for the maximum number of cuts that can be made in a given length depends on the maximum number of cuts previously made in shorter lengths, this question could be solved by the approach of Dynamic Programming. Suppose we are given a length ‘l’. For finding the maximum number of cuts that can be made in length ‘l’, find the number of cuts made in shorter previous length ‘l-p’, ‘l-q’, ‘l-r’ lengths respectively. 
The required answer would be the max(l-p,l-q,l-r)+1 as one more cut should be needed after this to cut length ‘l‘. So for solving this problem for a given length, find the maximum number of cuts that can be made in lengths ranging from ‘1’ to ‘l’.
