The idea is to utilise the left minimum concept.

STEPS:
1. Run a loop starting from the 1st index.
2. For every index, check if the selling on that day gives us a higher profit. We subsequently check if the price on that day is lower than of the days previously encountered. If yes, then we update the buy value to it.
3. Return the ans.
