INTUITION: 
1. A minimise the maximum kind of problem, therefore we can think of using binary search.
2. Assume the value of k is equal to the number of books given, the answer in this case would be the maximum element in the array.
3. Next assume that the value of k is given as 1, the answer in this case would be the sum of the array.
4. Now we know that the answer lies somewhere in between them, this value is what we try to find using binary search.
