The main idea I had was to use DFS for this question.
I used recursion for the DFS and a stack for keeping track of the current path.
In the recursion, we have the base case where we check if the current node is null or not. If null, we return.
If not null, we add the current node to the stack.
We then check if the current node is a leaf node or not.
If it's a leaf node, we add our current path to the array list. Else we continue.
We call left recursion followed by right recursion and at the end we pop the current element from the stack and backtrack.
