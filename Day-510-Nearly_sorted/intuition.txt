The idea is to use a sliding window to keep track of k elements at a time, and use a priority queue to sort them.

STEPS:
1. Have a priority queue and store the first k elements in it.
2. Start a loop starting from kth index.
3. For every index, add the corresponding element and poll an element from the priority queue. This will give us the element that needs to be put at the (index-k)th place.
4. After exiting the loop, there will still be k elements remaining in the pq. We will run a while loop to poll these elements and put them in the array.
