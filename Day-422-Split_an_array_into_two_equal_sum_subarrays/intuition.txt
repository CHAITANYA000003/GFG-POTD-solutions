APPROACH:
1. Calculate the total sum of the array
2. If the sum is odd we can immediately return false
3. Divide it by 2, this will be our target to achieve
4. Traverse the array while keeping track of the current sum
    - If the current sum equals our target, return true
    - If the current sum becomes greater than our target, return false
5. Return false
