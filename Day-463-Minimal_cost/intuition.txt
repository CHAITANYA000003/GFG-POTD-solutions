INTUITION:
We have to explore all the possible paths and find the minimum cost among them. We can use dp to find the most optimised solution.

STEPS:
1. We initialize a dynamic programming array dp of size n with all elements set to infinity, except for the first element which is set to 0.
2. We iterate through the array from the second element to the last element.
3. For each element, we iterate from 1 to k (inclusive) and update the dp value at the current index i to be the minimum of its current value and the dp value at i-j plus the absolute difference between the current element and the element at i-j.
4. Finally, we return the dp value at the last index, which represents the minimum cost of traversing the entire array.
