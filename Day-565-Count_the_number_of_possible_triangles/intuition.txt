INTUITION:
1. The brute force solution would take O(n^3) time complexity.
2. We can optimize this using sorting and two-pointer technique.
    - Sort the array in descending order.
    - For each element, apply two pointer approach to count the number of pairs whose sum is greater than it.
    - Add it to the count.
