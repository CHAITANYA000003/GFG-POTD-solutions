APPROACH
1. Graph Representation: Represent the graph using an adjacency list since it is space-efficient for sparse graphs.
2. Initialization: Start BFS from the source node.
Initialize a list to keep track of the shortest distance to each node, initially set to -1 (indicating unreachable nodes). The distance to the source node is 0.
3. BFS Traversal: Use a queue to manage the current level of nodes being explored. For each node, explore its neighbors and update their shortest distance if they haven't been visited yet.
4. Edge Cases: If a node is not reachable from the source node, it remains -1 in the shortest distance list.
 
This method ensures that the shortest path to each node is found in linear time relative to the number of vertices and edges
