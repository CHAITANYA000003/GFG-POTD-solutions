INTUITION:
1. We can use a HashMap to solve this problem.
2. The sorted string for all the anagrams would be same. Therefore, we can use this as the key in our hash map.
3. The value part would be a list of all the strings that are anagrams. At the end, we can return all these lists in our ans list.
