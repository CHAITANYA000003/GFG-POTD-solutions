STEPS:

1. We sort the given array based on the ending times first.
2. Then we iterate the array starting from index 1, checking the starting time of the current meeting with the ending time of previous meeting.
3. If it is greater or equal, we continue the loop.
4. Else, we return false.
5. At the end, if we successfully iterate through the array we return true.
