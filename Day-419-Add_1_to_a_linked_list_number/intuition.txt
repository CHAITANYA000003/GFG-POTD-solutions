Approach:
1. Reverse the linked list:
   This allows us to start the addition from the least significant digit.

2. Add 1 to the number:
   - Traverse the reversed list, adding 1 to the first node.
   - Propagate any carry to subsequent nodes.
   - If there's still a carry after reaching the end, add a new node.

3. Reverse the list again:
   This restores the original order of digits.
