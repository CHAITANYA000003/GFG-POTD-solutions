The  thing that we are gonna do here is called as SERIALIZATION. For those who don't know it " Serialization is to store the tree in a file so that it can be later restored."
We are serializing every subtree possible in the form of string here of the given tree.
Here we are using a DFS approach to traverse the tree and generate each subtree into a string using a inorder traversal.
Each generated string includes the data of the current node and generated subtree of its left and right , separated by a special character ("#").

INORDER TRAVERSAL AND SERIALIZATION:
The inorder function performs an inorder traversal of the binary tree.
For each node, it recursively serializes the left subtree, then the right subtree, and combines them with the current node's value to form a unique string representation of the subtree rooted at the current node.
The format used for serialization is leftSubtree # rootValue # rightSubtree.


UPDATE FREQUENCY MAP:
The serialized subtree string is added to the hm map, updating its frequency count.
If a subtree's frequency becomes 2 (i.e., the subtree has been encountered before and this is the second occurrence), add the current node to the ans list.
