We used PREORDER traversal to solve this question.
We search the left and right subtrees recursively to find the target element. If the element is we found we return 'true', else 'false'.
If the target is found in the subtree, then we add the parent element's data in the answer list. Thus keeping track of all the ancestors of the required node.
