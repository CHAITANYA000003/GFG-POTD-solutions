INTUITION:
The key insight is to recognize that the sequence of numbers without 9 can be mapped to a base-9 number system.

APPROACH:
1. We treat the input n as if it's a number in base-9.
2. We convert this base-9 number to base-10, building the result from right to left.
3. For each digit of n (in base-9):
   - We multiply the digit by the appropriate power of 10 (for base-10)
   - We add this to our result
   - We move to the next digit by dividing n by 9
4. We continue this process until n becomes 0.
