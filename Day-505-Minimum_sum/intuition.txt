STEPS:
1. We begin by sorting the input array.
2. All the digits at alternate positions will become part of a number. Therefore, we maintain 2 lists to store the digits of each number.
3. Next we perform addition of 2 lists and find a new resultant list.
4. Finally, we append the digits of the resultant list to a String and return this values.

NOTE: Use StringBuilder instead of regular String. Using regular strings to perform append operations can take a time complexity of O(n^2) which would give us TLE. StringBuilder does this in O(n).
