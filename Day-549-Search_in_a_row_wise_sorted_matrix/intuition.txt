INTUITION:
1. It is given that each row is sorted.
2. Since there is no relation between the rows and columns, we have no other choice but to perform binary search on each row.
3. A minor optimization would be to check the range of the current row with the target and see if it is possible to find the target in the current row.
4. TC: O(n*logm)
