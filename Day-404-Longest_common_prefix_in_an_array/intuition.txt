1. Find the string with the minimum length in the array(not compulsory, but it will help us perform minimum number of comparisons later on and also to stay in range without requiring any additional condition checks)
2. For each string in the array, find the common prefix with the min_string or ans.
3. Update the ans to the string with the minimum length between the current prefix and ans.
