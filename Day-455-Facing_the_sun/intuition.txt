We maintain a 'maxi' variable which keeps track of the largest height of the building we have encountered so far.
We traverse the array and for every building we check its height:
    - If it is taller than 'maxi', we increase our answer count and store this height in 'maxi'
    - If it is shorter or equal we simply continue the loop
Return the count after exiting the loop
