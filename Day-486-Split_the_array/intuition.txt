Approach Explanation:
1. Check Total XOR:
    - First, compute the total XOR of the entire array. If this total XOR is non-zero, it is impossible to split the array into two groups with equal XOR, and the answer is 0.

2.Valid Splitting Case (Total XOR is Zero):
    - If the total XOR is 0, it means there are several ways to split the array into two groups.
    - The number of valid ways to partition the array is based on selecting subsets from the array. The number of ways to partition n elements is 2^(n-1) - 1.
    - The term 2^(n-1) represents the number of ways to partition the array into two non-empty subsets (since we ignore the empty subset).

3. Modular Arithmetic:
    - To avoid overflow and handle large numbers, we calculate the result using modulo 10^9 + 7.

4. Binary Exponentiation:
    - Since calculating powers of 2 for large n can result in huge numbers, we use binary exponentiation to compute powers efficiently in O(log n) time.
