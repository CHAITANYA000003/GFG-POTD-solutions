STEPS:
1. 0 mismatches: Already sorted, do dummy swaps (true).
2. 2 or >4 mismatches: Cannot be sorted with exactly two swaps (false).
3. 3 mismatches: Always sortable with two swaps (true).
4. 4 mismatches: We check if it is possible to set two numbers in their right place with a single swap. If yes, then we return true else false.
