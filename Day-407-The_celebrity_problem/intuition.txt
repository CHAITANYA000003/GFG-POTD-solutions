DESCRIPTION
A celebrity is defined as someone who is known by everyone but does not know anyone else.

Imagine a scenario where you are at a party with n people.
A square matrix mat is used to represent the relationships among the partygoers.
If mat[i][j] is 1, it means person i knows person j; if it is 0, person i does not know person j.
Your task is to determine the index of the celebrity if one exists; otherwise, return -1.


INTUITION
The key to solving the Celebrity Problem lies in understanding the definition of a celebrity:
1. A celebrity knows no one.
2. A celebrity is known by everyone else.

Given these properties, we can deduce that:
- In the matrix mat, the row corresponding to the celebrity should have all zeros.
- The column corresponding to the celebrity should have all ones, except for the diagonal element (which represents the celebrity knowing themselves and should be zero).


APPROACH
To find the celebrity, we need to:
1. Iterate through each person and check if they meet the criteria of a celebrity.
2. Specifically, for a person i:
   - Ensure the sum of row i is 0 (indicating they know no one).
   - Ensure the sum of column i is n-1 (indicating everyone else knows them).

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Initialize the number of people at the party as num_people.
2. Iterate through each person and calculate:
   - The sum of the row for that person.
   - The sum of the column for that person.
3. If the person meets both conditions, return their index.
4. If no such person is found, return -1.
