We will be using PREORDER traversal to solve this problem (the other traversals can also be used).
We will consider vertical levels.
The level of the root node will be considered as 0.
The preorder traversal function will have an additional 'level' parameter.
Every time we move left we decrease the value of this level parameter by 1, and when we move right we increment it by 1.
Now we can use a map to keep track of the level and its corresponding sum. We used a TreeMap in this case as it stores the data in sorted order(based on key value by default).
Finally, we traverse through the entry set and store the values in an array list and return it.
